## Why I created It ? - For Organization and Students

1. **If you are an organization** looking to track your students' articles as assignments, it can be a cumbersome task
to search through all the articles on Hashnode and then find the corresponding contact details to send them.

2. **If you are a student** wanting to explore all the articles published for that organization as assignments,
you can access all the articles in one place, complete with links, author details, and much more.


## How an organization and its students can seamlessly track articles and provide feedback?

1. **Ask Students to just add Two tags** - which you can assign them when giving assignments - (Your Org Tag) (Topic of Article)
2. **Ask Students to add their Github Profile on Hashnode**
3. **Integrate your Org's Mail with Gmail API**

   Now you will be able to track all articles of your students, and anyone from your Org whom you allow can send
   personalized feedback in just one Click, with just need to add Feedback, other details Pre-Filled
